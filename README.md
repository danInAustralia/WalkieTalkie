# WalkieTalkie
Thanks for visiting. This project is a proof of concept for allowing two Android devices within Wifi range (<100 metres) to make voice calls without an access point or cell tower. This could be useful if you are out in the countryside without cellular access and wish to communicate with users in a nearby car etc. To test you will require a computer with Android Studio to install the app onto both of your Android devices.

Installation:
1.install Android Studio to open this project. Once installed, open the project and allow the system to install the required libraries. 
2. Attach your device via USB to your computer. You should see your device in the devices drop down.
3. Select your device from the drop-down and hit the play button to install the app onto your device.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for your other devices.

Making a call:
1. Start the application on both devices.
2. You should see your respective devices on the 'Nearby devices' list (note that this currently picks up all devices that support Wifi direct and may not have the WalkieTalkie app running to receive calls).
3. Select the device you wish to call on your device.
4. The other device should see a connection request message pop-up on their screen and can choose to accept.
5. You should be able to hear audio from the respective device's microphones.
